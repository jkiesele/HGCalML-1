file reserved for global constants used by multiple modules

(from a c++ perspective:)
Use classes as 'namespace' and implement through
getters and setters so that const-ness is ensured

As these are namespace equivalentes, Class capitalisation
does not apply here.

See the example of the cluster space class, which can be accessed by

from globals import cluster_space

> print(cluster_space.noise_coord) 
100.
> cluster_space.noise_coord=10.

class pu(_const):

    special constants associated to pile up to make
    'standard-style' particle-in-pu plots. Don't overuse

    The hgcal has 2x3M sensors, so there will be max 6M truth showers
    in one event, so 10M is a good offset, and well within int32 range.
    Still, if used, please always add a safety check before such as e.g.:
      if np.max(t_idx) >= pu.t_idx_offset:
          raise ValueError(...)
